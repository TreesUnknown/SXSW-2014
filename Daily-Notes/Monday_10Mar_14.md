Half of fact-checking sites use a rating system.

PolitiFact Australia - Opened 2013, now closed.

Faktomat - Used crowdsourcing to discover claims, 2 editors verified claims

[Reality Check](http://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check) (The Guardian) - Website tags fact-checking articles.

Need fact-checkers outside of an election cycle.

>The Holy Trinity: HTML, Javascript, CSS

*The Typical CMS:*

- Application code (the CMS itself)
- Templating logic (themes)
- Content database
- Generates page dynamically

>Browsers only speak "The Holy Trinity"

*Static Site Stack:*  
Browser: HTML, CSS, Javascript
File server: Nginx/S3/CDN

Distributed Version Control Workflow:

| Subject Matter Experts |
| :----------------:|
| Write → Commit → Pull Request |
| **Stakeholders**|
| Review → Propose → Discuss |
| **Publish** |

>"Markdown is great for creating content for websites. However, there is a learning curve since there isn't a CMS editor to hold your hand."

>"If content is separate from the presentation, both disciplines benefit from the control."

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - Static site generator

>"Page is generated when content changes not when user requests a page."

*Things to consider:*

- Great for sites that don't update frequently
- Tools lack polish/ease of use
- Forces parts of the workflow offline
- Content owners may miss safety nets
- Learning curve

"The feedback loop in & out of government is broken"

Using geographic analysis in participatory budgeting:

>Q: Should library hours be extended?

A large group of respondents wanted to extend library hours.  However, most of those wanting to extend the hours lived near a particular library branch. So, the hours were extended for that branch. This allowed resources to be utilized to satisfy needs from other respondents.

I felt bad for this guy since he basically talked about the same topic as one of the speakers before him. However, he talked in general terms without any references to specific apps or engagement platforms.
