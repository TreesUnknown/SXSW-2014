Do you want the government to be less effective when companies are more effective?

- Written on judges' lack of technical knowledge
>"The idea of expert witness who are not beholden to the parties who can provide information to judges and juries on technical issues, I think is a terrific opportunity worth exploring" [cite](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-11/business/ct-biz-0511-chicago-law-20120511_1_judges-law-clerks-7th-circuit-bar-association)

- Crowdsource platform open to michigan.gov emails
- Collected ideas, but no mechanism to implement

[Three Winners Were Selected](http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57577-289867--,00.html):

- David Coger, transportation engineer, Michigan Department of Transportation, who suggested cutting down on the number of passwords to access state employee websites. Because of Coger's idea, the state is working on a software solution to address the password situation. A new tool will be piloted soon and Coger will be among the employees invited to participate in the project.
 
- Selena R. Friend, MDOT associate region engineer for development in MDOT's Bay Region, who suggested notifying job applicants when they are not selected for interviews. Following up on Friend's suggestion, the Department of Civil Service is coordinating with human resource professionals across state government to implement the change.
 
- Tom Barrett, a Department of Treasury analyst, who suggested that Pure Michigan billboards include the names of the scenic locations that are featured in the marketing campaign's photos. The Michigan Economic Development Corp. will incorporate Barrett's suggestion into its 2013 advertising plan.

How do you sustain crowdsourcing?  
Long-term plan for implementing.  
Focus and narrow goal.
